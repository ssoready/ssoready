                Rotates a SCIM directory's bearer token.

                 Every SCIM directory has a bearer token that SSOReady uses to authenticate requests sent from your customer's
                 Identity Provider. These bearer tokens are assigned by SSOReady, and are secret. Newly-created SCIM directories do
                 not have any bearer token at all; you must use this endpoint to get an initial value.

                 Rotating a SCIM directory bearer token immediately invalidates the previous bearer token, if any. Your customer
                 will need to update their SCIM configuration with the new value to make SCIM syncing work again.

                 SSOReady only stores the hash of these bearer tokens. If your customer has lost their copy, you must use this
                 endpoint to generate a new one.

                         Identity Providers are inconsistent about reliably deleting SCIM groups. Many Identity Providers will deprovision
                         the users inside a group, but not the group itself. For this reason, it's typical to ignore this field until a
                         specific need arises.

                         Identity Providers are inconsistent about supporting sending custom attributes on groups. For this reason, it's
                         typical to not rely on them until a specific need arises.

            description: 'The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).'
